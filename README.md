# Hibernate_Sequence_Generator_Annotation
It uses the sequence of the database. if there is no sequence defined, it creates a sequence automatically e.g. in case of Oracle database, it creates a sequence named HIBERNATE_SEQUENCE. In case of Oracle, DB2, SAP DB, Postgre SQL or McKoi, it uses sequence but it uses generator in interbase.
